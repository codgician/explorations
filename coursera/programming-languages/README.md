Homepage: [U Washington](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/13sp/) | [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)

## Learning a new programming language

Keep these concepts in your mind:

- **Syntax**: How do you write language constructs?
- **Semantics**: What do programs mean (evaluation rules)?
- **Idioms**: What are typical patterns for using language features to express your computation?
- **Libraries**: What facilities does the language (or a well-known project) provide "standard" (e.g. file access, data structures)?
- **Tools**: What do language implementations provide to make your job easier (e.g. REPL, debugger, code formatter, ... NOT actually part of the language)?
